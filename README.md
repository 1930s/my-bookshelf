Collection of books/papers that I've read/I'm going to read/I would remember that they exist/It is unlikely that I'll read/I'll never read.

The list of items is stored in [`bookshelf.txt`](./bookshelf.txt) in the following format:

    item_name1 \t link1 \t tag1 \t tag2 \t ...
    item_name2 \t link2 \t tag1 \t tag2 \t ...
